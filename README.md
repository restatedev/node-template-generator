# Restate Template for TypeScript / NodeJS services

This is a template for a [Restate-based](https://restate.dev/) service in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## tl;dr

To create a template service, use this sequence of commands:

```shell
npx -y @restatedev/create-app@latest
cd restate-node-template

npm install

npm run app-dev
```

For more details, check the [Get started documentation](https://docs.restate.dev/get_started/quickstart?sdk=ts)

# Contributing to this template

The template that is generated by the `npx @restatedev/create-app` is available here: https://github.com/restatedev/examples/tree/main/typescript/templates/node

The last released version is automatically picked up by the tool.

### Releasing via release-it

Releasing a new npm package from this repo requires:

- [SSH access configured for Github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) in order to push commits and tags to GitHub
- A GitHub personal access token with access to https://github.com/restatedev/node-template-generator in your environment as `GITHUB_TOKEN` in order to create a Github release

```bash
npm run release
# now select what type of release you want to do and say yes to the rest of the options
```

The actual `npm publish` is run by GitHub actions once a GitHub release is created.

### Releasing manually

1. Create and push a tag of the form `vX.Y.Z` to the upstream repository
1. [Create a new GitHub release](https://github.com/restatedev/node-template-generator/releases)

Creating the GitHub release will trigger `npm publish` via GitHub actions.
